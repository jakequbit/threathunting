<h4>All things I use for threat hunting!</h4>
<p>Hey! I'm glad you could make it. Below is at the moment just a hodge-podge of all the resources I use to Threat Hunt that I decided to document for others and myself. I'll try to add anecdotes and use cases next to each piece, but at the very least EVERYTHING will be a link.

<h2>Frameworks</h2>
<p>The beginning of Threat Hunting is an intimate understanding of foundational frameworks and methodologies. (It's not as deep as it sounds)</p>

- [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org) - 
    - To get started: [Getting Started with ATT&CK](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/getting-started/home)
- [MITRE D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org) - If you've successfully mapped to ATT&CK IDs, your stakeholders will almost certainly ask: 'Now what?'
    - You'll find the answers here: [ATT&CK Mitigations to D3FEND Technique Mappings](https://d3fend.mitre.org/mappings/attack-mitigations)
    - Map by specific ATT&CK ID: https://d3fend.mitre.org/tools/attack-mapper
 
<h2>IOC Analytics</h2>
<p>These are just some open source tools I use to help enrich or give context to any traditional IOC's I might be working with.</p>
