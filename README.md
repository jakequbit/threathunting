<h4>All things I use (or have used) for threat hunting!</h4>
<p>Hey! I'm glad you could make it. Below is just a hodge-podge of all the resources I use to Threat Hunt. I'll try to add anecdotes and use cases next to each piece, but at the very least EVERYTHING will be a link.

<h2>Frameworks</h2>
<p>The beginning of Threat Hunting is an intimate understanding of foundational frameworks and methodologies. (It's not as deep as it sounds)</p>

- [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org)
    - To get started: [Getting Started with ATT&CK](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/getting-started/home)
- [MITRE D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org) - If you've successfully mapped to ATT&CK IDs, your stakeholders will almost certainly ask: 'Now what?'
    - You'll find the answers here: [ATT&CK Mitigations to D3FEND Technique Mappings](https://d3fend.mitre.org/mappings/attack-mitigations)
    - Map by specific ATT&CK ID: [ATT&CK ID to D3FEND MAPPER](https://d3fend.mitre.org/tools/attack-mapper)
- [MITRE CAR](https://car.mitre.org/)
- [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html)

<h2>Tools for the Hunt</h2>
<h4>Enterprise</h4>

- Firewalls, IDS/IPS
- Endpoint Detection and Response (Falcon, Carbon Black, MD4E)
- DNS Monitoring (it's always DNS)
 
<h4>IOC Analytics</h4>
<p>These are just some open source tools I use to help enrich or give context to any traditional IOC's I might be working with.</p>
